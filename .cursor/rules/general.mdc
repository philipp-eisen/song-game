## Icon Naming Convention

When importing icons from `@phosphor-icons/react`, always use the "Icon" suffix in the import name. For example:

- ✅ `SpotifyLogoIcon` (correct)
- ❌ `SpotifyLogo` (deprecated - do not use)

All icon imports from `@phosphor-icons/react` must end with "Icon" to maintain consistency across the codebase.

## Icon Weight Convention

All icons from `@phosphor-icons/react` must use `weight="duotone"` everywhere. This ensures visual consistency across the application.

- ✅ `<SpotifyLogoIcon weight="duotone" className="..." />` (correct)
- ❌ `<SpotifyLogoIcon weight="fill" className="..." />` (incorrect - do not use)
- ❌ `<SpotifyLogoIcon weight="bold" className="..." />` (incorrect - do not use)
- ❌ `<SpotifyLogoIcon className="..." />` (incorrect - weight prop is required)

All icon components must include `weight="duotone"` as a prop to maintain consistency across the codebase.
